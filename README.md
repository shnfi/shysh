<h1 align="center">ShySh</h1>
ShySh (shysh) is a more advanced version of the sshell, shell had many problems, like: <br>
- no scroll. <br>
- few commands to run becase of the lack of scroll. <br>
- segmentation faults that occurs because of the bad C source (lack of experience). <br>
- etc. <br>
So, the new sshell, called shysh is gonna be way better, without those problems of sshell.
