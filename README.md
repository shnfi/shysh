<h1 align="center">ShySh</h1>
ShySh (shysh) is a more advanced version of the sshell, shell had many problems, like: 
- no scroll.
- few commands to run becase of the lack of scroll.
- segmentation faults that occurs because of the bad C source (lack of experience).
- etc.
<br>
So, the new sshell, called shysh is gonna be way better, without those problems of sshell.
